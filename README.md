# Detecting-Pedestrians-using-YOLO
The Goal of the project is to identify whether a pedestrian is present in a video and accurately detect them using Open CV and YOLO algorithm.

The results were added as a separate video just for reference where the same can be viewed/downloaded using python code.

Thank you!
